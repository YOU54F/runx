runx
- go/yaml
- Runfile - support locating Runfile even when in nested dirs (like Rakefile)
- Zero dependencies
- --help/command enumeration
- Allow inline command documentation
- Allow arguments to be passed (e.g. runx foo --flag 1 2 3)
- Allow sub commands
- Variables?
- Allow for easy OS/platform consistency
- Would be good to allow for more involved scripting (e.g. deployments, multiple commands, error checking), but this would likely require a full-blown language
- Similar: batsh, lua, ...
